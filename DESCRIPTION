Version: 0.1.0
Author: Xavier Lee
Maintainer: Xavier Lee <xavierr@umich.edu>
Description: This package provides a streamlined implementation of linear 
    model fitting, allowing users to compute regression coefficients, 
    standard errors, t-values, p-values, and various model statistics 
    such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and F-statistics. It is designed 
    for ease of use and efficient analysis of linear relationships in 
    datasets. Suitable for both small-scale and introductory statistical 
    analyses.
